Email Mini-Blog <br />
------------------------------ <br />
<br />
Why a text-only version? <br />
* Some email programs don't support any HTML (the presentation language of the web). This helps you reach your contacts using those programs. <br />
* Some email programs allow readers to opt for plain text, if available; some people prefer the option. Reach them gracefully, too! <br />
* Spam filters are less likely to block your email. Few spammers include a text-only version. You set yourself apart from them. <br />
<br />

ABOUT THE HTML VERSION OF THIS EMAIL <br />
<br />
When this file is properly sent as email, it looks great almost anywhere it goes. <br />
* Wide screens and narrow screens. <br />
* Phones, tablets, computers, and more. <br />
* "Apple Macintosh", "Microsoft Windows", "Apple iOS", "Android", and other operating systems. <br />
* Email applications native to operating systems ("Apple Mail"), or available as add-ons ("Microsoft Outlook"); mail viewers inside various browsers, etc. <br />
* Email providers ("Gmail", "Outlook.com", Internet Service Providers (ISPs), corporate email systems, etc.) <br />
* Old versions of all the above. <br />
<br />
You can test different widths pretty easily in browsers and on different devices. Properly sending the HTML file as email is more difficult. Let us know; we're happy to help you at no cost! <br />
<br />
The value to you: You can be confident that when you send a beautiful email to a list of your contacts, every contact will see a message that best represents you. <br />
<br />

<br />
This signature block above is at the bottom of your developer's emails. <br />
* A blank line to separate from the body of the email. <br />
* Three dots to remind him to use a closing. <br />
* A blank line. <br />
* His name. <br />
* A picture (not in this text-only version) and traditional contact information. <br />
* Four lines to separate from the next message in a chain, should he use this for replies. <br />
<br />
Do you want a more elaborate signature block? You have access to all the same funtionality mentioned in the "Mini-Blog" section. <br />

What can you notice about the HTML file? <br />
-------------------------------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
* The "Mini-Blog" section can be an inspiration to you for having us develop periodic newsletters to your contacts. <br />
* The "Signature Block" section can be an inspiration to you for a particularly attractive and useful ending to all your emails. Some companies get extra branding impact by having all sales and marketing employees (or all employees) use the same signature block (personalized for each employee). <br />
* This plain text file accompanies the HTML. Few SPAM authors include this, so SPAM filters are less likely to block your email. Further, some contacts may configure their email programs for plain text, if available. You'll reach them more gracefully. <br />
* Mostly in the HTML version: <br />
&nbsp;** The colors, fonts, sizes, and formats of web sites are available to you. <br />
&nbsp;** The file is "responsive"--it adapts the presentation to the size of the reader's window. <br />
&nbsp;** You can arrange text in any number of columns you like (like newspapers). Parts of the HTML file use three columns; parts use two. <br />
&nbsp;** For narrow screen sizes, all columns are gracefully under one another. <br />
&nbsp;** You can use a divider (in this file, we use lines of many equal signs) to create a visual border between parts of your letter. In HTML, you can choose the color and size. <br />
&nbsp;** The contrast between letters and backgrounds (the difference in light and dark) is enough for most visually-impaired contacts to see. If you want to know details on the web standard, let us know. If you prefer to depend on us for this, we're ready! <br />
&nbsp;** No part of this file includes light text on a dark background. A small number of email programs still don't show background colors. For those, the result is light text on a white background. Maybe ... not good enough for you! <br />
<br />
<br />
The HTML file is a quick demo. Future versions of this demo will include: <br />
* Buttons <br />
* Social media icons <br />
* Slide shows (often called sliders or carousels) <br />
* Navigation bars <br />
* Areas where the reader can choose to view one of several pieces of content at a time (often called an accordian) <br />
<br />
Not enough features demonstrated here, you say? Want to see a feature in this demo before your decision to contract with us? <br />
